# HealthwatchDesign-Personal-Project

This is a **Figma design practice project** where I recreated the layout and interface of the current Healthwatch website.  
The goal of this exercise was to improve my visual design and UI replication skills by matching an existing brand’s layout, colors, and structure as closely as possible.

## 🎯 Objectives
- Strengthen my Figma proficiency
- Practice pixel-perfect layout recreation
- Improve understanding of real-world UI design consistency
- Explore responsive layout techniques
